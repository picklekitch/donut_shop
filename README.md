This program is built to generate a random number within a given series and then use that randomly generated number to return a value of donuts at a specific shop/time.

The results are then formatted into a table and displayed on the website. The displayed results will vary everytime the page is refreshed (due to the randomly generated number changing).

Used DOM manipulation to integrate JavaScript with HTML.
