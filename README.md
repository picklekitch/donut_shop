This program is built to generate a random number within a given series and then use that randomly generated number to return a value of donuts at a specific shop/time.

The results are then formatted into a table and displayed on the website. The displayed results will vary everytime the page is refreshed (due to the randomly generated number changing).

Used DOM manipulation to integrate JavaScript with HTML.

This was not my most inspiring day... struggled mightily with yesterdays lab and then spent most of today finishing it up. I'd like to thank my mom for teaching me the importance patience and perseverance, I wish I had learned better. In general, I admire Abraham Lincoln and Nikola Tesla very much for their ability to think differently and overcome personal setbacks and failures. Realistically Bill Waterson's "Calvin and Hobbes" are due the most credit as inspiration.
